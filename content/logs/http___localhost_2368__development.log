For me that was walking into a hackathon with some friends from our Techstars Austin class. Not knowing anything about coding at all (I was there to watch), I was encouraged to learn instead of building something. With the help of four guys who are the keystone to my small success so far on this journey, I was able to put together a small one page bio through MeteorJS and walk away with a bug that I couldn't get rid of.\\nThis single day would start me on a journey that ended up changing the course of my life and showing me a real passion to get behind. I left Austin at a crossroads of going into the fourth year with the startup, Freetextbooks.com, and feeling like that tank was empty, but not ready to admit that. With the encouragement and also a little push from some important people I made the decision to go in a totally different direction then where my early years out of college had taken me…… the world of web development.\\nThere are some important things to note: 1. The southeast is not a thriving community when it comes to development classes or bootcamps and 2. I still really didn't know anything about coding outside of \\\"googling\\\" it.\\nI began to look around and applied to a couple of bootcamps/programs across the country ranging from a couple weeks to 6 months in length in all various languages and curriculums. I finally decided on General Assembly's Web Development Immersive in NYC with a turn around of about 4 weeks was on a plane headed to the big city with the full expectation of being completely lost by the second week.\\nAfter three weeks I built a portfolio site and also a web-sockets chat app. At 9 weeks had built both a full ruby and node app, both with working databases. and at 12 weeks had completed final project of a product based list app with friends list and encrypted login. More on the program and what I learned later, but I decided to leave NYC knowing my family, friends, and most importantly my professional connections were in the deep south. Coming back I knew I had a couple of small freelance projects lined up but knew nothing of the dev community in Birmingham, AL or the surrounding cities of Nashville, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. Now someone interviewing for jobs in web development with around 4 months experience is not the most appealing candidate. Thankfully I was scooped up by a creative think-tank called Telegraph Branding to help on their interactive and web development side, and the learning and passion has yet to calm down.\\nThe journey was not the easiest and I have never worked hard or longer then I did in those 4 months in NYC. It probably helped that November through February are not the most ideal months to be outside in New York City. That being said, once I knew this was where I was suppose to be the long hours did not become a burden but more a blessing with the desire to learn more and more. People now ask me what it is I learned at GA and they usually mean what language or skills. But that is really a small piece of a couple of bigger things that I learned.\\nOf all that I learned there are three things that stand out the most and what drive me each day to continue to push myself and my new found passion. The first being in anything but most importantly the coding bootcamp/immersive, you only get out of it what you put in. There are people that come into this world expecting to be taught a language and be able to make more money. In my opinion those people are the ones that end up blogging or writing reviews about how they didnt learn anything. Its something you have to \\\"learn to learn\\\" and let the language they are teaching you be the application of the moment to drive that engine. the amount that I have taught myself outside of the program since is equal to if not more then what I learned there but it is all because of the foundation laid by my instructors during the program.\\nSecondly, like I just mentioned you have to continue to learn and have the understanding that it will never stop or even plateau off for a while. If I do not force myself to learn something new each day then in reality I am falling behind or not making the most of the chance that I have been given.\\nAnd lastly just like the four guys that set me on this course a year ago, be there and help teach others just like I had the opportunity to. The development community some say has long been a world where teaching was at the forefront and self learning was the main avenue to get in (along with multi year college programs).

For me that was walking into a hackathon with some friends from our Techstars Austin class. Not knowing anything about coding at all (I was there to watch), I was encouraged to learn instead of building something. With the help of four guys who are the keystone to my small success so far on this journey, I was able to put together a small one page bio through MeteorJS and walk away with a bug that I couldn't get rid of.\\n\\nThis single day would start me on a journey that ended up changing the course of my life and showing me a real passion to get behind. I left Austin at a crossroads of going into the fourth year with the startup, Freetextbooks.com, and feeling like that tank was empty, but not ready to admit that. With the encouragement and also a little push from some important people I made the decision to go in a totally different direction then where my early years out of college had taken me…… the world of web development.\\n\\n![1_8EykOAVcpenJC8zwbP-_TA](/content/images/2018/05/1_8EykOAVcpenJC8zwbP-_TA.png)\\n\\nThere are some important things to note: 1. The southeast is not a thriving community when it comes to development classes or bootcamps and 2. I still really didn't know anything about coding outside of \\\"googling\\\" it.\\nI began to look around and applied to a couple of bootcamps/programs across the country ranging from a couple weeks to 6 months in length in all various languages and curriculums. I finally decided on General Assembly's Web Development Immersive in NYC with a turn around of about 4 weeks was on a plane headed to the big city with the full expectation of being completely lost by the second week.\\n\\nAfter three weeks I built a portfolio site and also a web-sockets chat app. At 9 weeks had built both a full ruby and node app, both with working databases. and at 12 weeks had completed final project of a product based list app with friends list and encrypted login. More on the program and what I learned later, but I decided to leave NYC knowing my family, friends, and most importantly my professional connections were in the deep south. Coming back I knew I had a couple of small freelance projects lined up but knew nothing of the dev community in Birmingham, AL or the surrounding cities of Nashville, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. Now someone interviewing for jobs in web development with around 4 months experience is not the most appealing candidate. Thankfully I was scooped up by a creative think-tank called Telegraph Branding to help on their interactive and web development side, and the learning and passion has yet to calm down.\\n\\nThe journey was not the easiest and I have never worked hard or longer then I did in those 4 months in NYC. It probably helped that November through February are not the most ideal months to be outside in New York City. That being said, once I knew this was where I was suppose to be the long hours did not become a burden but more a blessing with the desire to learn more and more. People now ask me what it is I learned at GA and they usually mean what language or skills. But that is really a small piece of a couple of bigger things that I learned.\\n\\n![1__MWOoPqY1uPyKiBYh1yZ1A](/content/images/2018/05/1__MWOoPqY1uPyKiBYh1yZ1A.png)\\n\\nOf all that I learned there are three things that stand out the most and what drive me each day to continue to push myself and my new found passion. The first being in anything but most importantly the coding bootcamp/immersive, you only get out of it what you put in. There are people that come into this world expecting to be taught a language and be able to make more money. In my opinion those people are the ones that end up blogging or writing reviews about how they didnt learn anything. Its something you have to \\\"learn to learn\\\" and let the language they are teaching you be the application of the moment to drive that engine. the amount that I have taught myself outside of the program since is equal to if not more then what I learned there but it is all because of the foundation laid by my instructors during the program.\\nSecondly, like I just mentioned you have to continue to learn and have the understanding that it will never stop or even plateau off for a while. If I do not force myself to learn something new each day then in reality I am falling behind or not making the most of the chance that I have been given.\\n\\n![1_LkyZI6uC8MZHCqraq5-diA](/content/images/2018/05/1_LkyZI6uC8MZHCqraq5-diA.png)\\n\\nAnd lastly just like the four guys that set me on this course a year ago, be there and help teach others just like I had the opportunity to. The development community some say has long been a world where teaching was at the forefront and self learning was the main avenue to get in (along with multi year college programs). I would not have found my passion if it wasn't for four men in a small office with a couple computers and some cheap beer. Nick Persico, Dave Redding, Evan Hammer, and Matt Jared… Im grateful and thankful for your patience and friendships.\\n\\nTo those looking to start the same journey, two words: DO IT!\\nIf you have any questions about bootcamps and specifically the General Assembly WDI course feel free to email me at jacksrf@gmail.com or contact me at thethird.co, I would be more then happy to answer any questions you have.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2018-05-25T20:28:11.000Z","slug":"untitled","status":"published","title":"Life Pivot","updated_at":"2018-05-25T20:28:11.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1fa0-BRJHavaEeZwGyS9qIUQJiz5/RUE\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"150ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-05-25T20:29:05.850Z","v":0}

We are loud, we are brash, and we will intrude on your table and evening not on purpose and not at your asking. If you you embrace it you will love it.\\n\\nSee to me, my family is the heart, and it’s where I feel at home. Home to me is not some building or location but its where my people are. Its where you come in perfect to them and flawed to yourself. Its where you come in accepted no matter what. Its where you will be told what you don’t want to hear but need to hear. Its a refuge from your troubles and break from the stress. Its where the wine flows as much as the tears. Its the Facetime calls when part lives in another state. Its where you never feel ashamed or embarrassed, and you never hold anything, anyone says against them. Its where you have names like birdie, bubby, sissy, doodah, and you use them in public. Its where a 2 year old is the center of everything, but also that glue and reminder to a lot of brokenness. Its where my fondest and happiest memories are, but also shelter in some of my saddest and loneliest. Its where the epitome of grace is felt, the type of grace to will bring you to your knees. The type of grace that changes your heart forever. The type of grace that gives you a small glimpse of heaven.\\n\\nMy family isn’t perfect, we’re broken and flawed to the core. But they are always the right thing at the right time. They are home and home is where the heart is, right?\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2018-05-25T20:31:07.000Z","slug":"home-is-where-family-is-family-is-the-heart","status":"published","title":"Home is where Family is, Family is the Heart.","updated_at":"2018-05-25T20:31:07.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"12f5-VNMJI5TKchaHqhlt0kbW/BD7exM\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"106ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-05-25T20:32:52.043Z","v":0}

We are loud, we are brash, and we will intrude on your table and evening not on purpose and not at your asking. If you you embrace it you will love it.\\n\\nSee to me, my family is the heart, and it’s where I feel at home. Home to me is not some building or location but its where my people are. Its where you come in perfect to them and flawed to yourself. Its where you come in accepted no matter what. Its where you will be told what you don’t want to hear but need to hear. Its a refuge from your troubles and break from the stress. Its where the wine flows as much as the tears. Its the Facetime calls when part lives in another state. Its where you never feel ashamed or embarrassed, and you never hold anything, anyone says against them. Its where you have names like birdie, bubby, sissy, doodah, and you use them in public. Its where a 2 year old is the center of everything, but also that glue and reminder to a lot of brokenness. Its where my fondest and happiest memories are, but also shelter in some of my saddest and loneliest. Its where the epitome of grace is felt, the type of grace to will bring you to your knees. The type of grace that changes your heart forever. The type of grace that gives you a small glimpse of heaven.\\n\\nMy family isn’t perfect, we’re broken and flawed to the core. But they are always the right thing at the right time. They are home and home is where the heart is, right?\\n\\n![1_Gcu0UTLi_CfCalK4YyaAFg](/content/images/2018/05/1_Gcu0UTLi_CfCalK4YyaAFg.jpg)\\n\\n![1_E1I6ZGrmBVFA3KD82U65aw](/content/images/2018/05/1_E1I6ZGrmBVFA3KD82U65aw.jpg)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2018-05-25T20:31:07.000Z","slug":"home-is-where-family-is-family-is-the-heart","status":"published","title":"Home is where Family is, Family is the Heart.","updated_at":"2018-05-25T20:35:08.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1b19-5yExOOd4Si92AEEJesinOcS5zic\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"94ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-05-25T20:36:34.923Z","v":0}

Thought this would be a great thought for post #2. As there will be a couple of posts dedicated to side points I will mention in here, Ill try to stay on topic as much as I can.\\n\\nI am the guy that went to college not knowing what I really wanted to do. I didn’t have a passion growing up like most do a desire for medical, law, business, art, or engineering. I would say I was mostly business and engineering in that list but really didn’t have a strong passion to learn more in either case. I think I would pick those just based off of genetics.\\n\\nTruly finding what you love to do is part passion and part dedicating every moment you can to getting as good as you can get at it. I heard someone mention one time that you have 21–24 working days in a month. 7–8 of those days will be ones where you are on fire and loving what you do no matter what, 7–8 of those days will also be hard days where either circumstance or energy make it hard to want to keep doing what you are doing. Its the 7–8 where you can capitalize and really do something awesome. The thing for me with that scenario is, why cant you find something that makes all 21–24 maximized. I still agree that you have bad days every month, but I feel like even in those bad days at the end I still love what I do.\\n\\nIm not going to get into the story of my lightbulb moment and other details, but if you want to read about it then here it is. More important is the why and how I got to that point. I was at a point where I felt like I was working just to work, “for the weekend”, “for a paycheck”, like I was constantly having to prove myself, and in reality I didn’t have a defined skill. And anything I looked into was basically pointing me to Grad School (future post coming on this subject). Luckily I had someone convince me to keep working for them and not go that route. In that next two years had an opportunity to try something new, ended up being really good at it, constantly read and tinkered in my off-time with it to the point where I got frustrated with not growing fast enough. This was the lightbulb moment I guess. Where I loved it enough to want to quit my job, move across the country and learn as fast and as much as possible.\\n\\nTo that point though its not easy getting to that point with our generation, where we change the course 5 years after we think we should be. Where you have that feeling of being behind all your friends or that you have taken multiple steps back in life (when you really haven’t) and you doubt if it will ever work out. I was there but I also understood I would never be truly happy in the current situation and that pushed me just the right amount. I went for it.\\n\\nOnce you go in that direction, you have to go after it hard and with even more passion or you will end up right back where you were. I could say something cliché here like “do what you love and money takes care of itself” or “find what you love and you will never work a day in your life”. Both are true but you still have to protect yourself and demand your value. But I will say the days become more enjoyable and you go from feeling like you have to prove yourself to nothing is impossible. You go from looking forward to 5, to looking forward to whenever you get to the office. You go from someone people don’t enjoy being around at work to someone they do.\\n\\nLastly don’t run after someone else’s dream. We are all wired differently and created differently and just because it looks great or looks happy doesn’t mean you will be happy in it. Go after what fuels you and what you love doing to change the world.\\n\\n(These are not coherent thoughts, I KNOW, but hopefully they will somehow make sense as you read this.

Thought this would be a great thought for post #2. As there will be a couple of posts dedicated to side points I will mention in here, Ill try to stay on topic as much as I can.\\n\\nI am the guy that went to college not knowing what I really wanted to do. I didn’t have a passion growing up like most do a desire for medical, law, business, art, or engineering. I would say I was mostly business and engineering in that list but really didn’t have a strong passion to learn more in either case. I think I would pick those just based off of genetics.\\n\\nTruly finding what you love to do is part passion and part dedicating every moment you can to getting as good as you can get at it. I heard someone mention one time that you have 21–24 working days in a month. 7–8 of those days will be ones where you are on fire and loving what you do no matter what, 7–8 of those days will also be hard days where either circumstance or energy make it hard to want to keep doing what you are doing. Its the 7–8 where you can capitalize and really do something awesome. The thing for me with that scenario is, why cant you find something that makes all 21–24 maximized. I still agree that you have bad days every month, but I feel like even in those bad days at the end I still love what I do.\\n\\nIm not going to get into the story of my lightbulb moment and other details, but if you want to read about it then here it is. More important is the why and how I got to that point. I was at a point where I felt like I was working just to work, “for the weekend”, “for a paycheck”, like I was constantly having to prove myself, and in reality I didn’t have a defined skill. And anything I looked into was basically pointing me to Grad School (future post coming on this subject). Luckily I had someone convince me to keep working for them and not go that route. In that next two years had an opportunity to try something new, ended up being really good at it, constantly read and tinkered in my off-time with it to the point where I got frustrated with not growing fast enough. This was the lightbulb moment I guess. Where I loved it enough to want to quit my job, move across the country and learn as fast and as much as possible.\\n\\nTo that point though its not easy getting to that point with our generation, where we change the course 5 years after we think we should be. Where you have that feeling of being behind all your friends or that you have taken multiple steps back in life (when you really haven’t) and you doubt if it will ever work out. I was there but I also understood I would never be truly happy in the current situation and that pushed me just the right amount. I went for it.\\n\\nOnce you go in that direction, you have to go after it hard and with even more passion or you will end up right back where you were. I could say something cliché here like “do what you love and money takes care of itself” or “find what you love and you will never work a day in your life”. Both are true but you still have to protect yourself and demand your value. But I will say the days become more enjoyable and you go from feeling like you have to prove yourself to nothing is impossible. You go from looking forward to 5, to looking forward to whenever you get to the office. You go from someone people don’t enjoy being around at work to someone they do.\\n\\nLastly don’t run after someone else’s dream. We are all wired differently and created differently and just because it looks great or looks happy doesn’t mean you will be happy in it. Go after what fuels you and what you love doing to change the world.\\n\\n(These are not coherent thoughts, I KNOW, but hopefully they will somehow make sense as you read this.

I would say I was mostly business and engineering in that list but really didn’t have a strong passion to learn more in either case. I think I would pick those just based off of genetics.\\n\\nTruly finding what you love to do is part passion and part dedicating every moment you can to getting as good as you can get at it. I heard someone mention one time that you have 21–24 working days in a month. 7–8 of those days will be ones where you are on fire and loving what you do no matter what, 7–8 of those days will also be hard days where either circumstance or energy make it hard to want to keep doing what you are doing. Its the 7–8 where you can capitalize and really do something awesome. The thing for me with that scenario is, why cant you find something that makes all 21–24 maximized. I still agree that you have bad days every month, but I feel like even in those bad days at the end I still love what I do.\\n\\nIm not going to get into the story of my lightbulb moment and other details, but if you want to read about it then here it is. More important is the why and how I got to that point. I was at a point where I felt like I was working just to work, “for the weekend”, “for a paycheck”, like I was constantly having to prove myself, and in reality I didn’t have a defined skill. And anything I looked into was basically pointing me to Grad School (future post coming on this subject). Luckily I had someone convince me to keep working for them and not go that route. In that next two years had an opportunity to try something new, ended up being really good at it, constantly read and tinkered in my off-time with it to the point where I got frustrated with not growing fast enough. This was the lightbulb moment I guess. Where I loved it enough to want to quit my job, move across the country and learn as fast and as much as possible.\\n\\nTo that point though its not easy getting to that point with our generation, where we change the course 5 years after we think we should be. Where you have that feeling of being behind all your friends or that you have taken multiple steps back in life (when you really haven’t) and you doubt if it will ever work out. I was there but I also understood I would never be truly happy in the current situation and that pushed me just the right amount. I went for it.\\n\\nOnce you go in that direction, you have to go after it hard and with even more passion or you will end up right back where you were. I could say something cliché here like “do what you love and money takes care of itself” or “find what you love and you will never work a day in your life”. Both are true but you still have to protect yourself and demand your value. But I will say the days become more enjoyable and you go from feeling like you have to prove yourself to nothing is impossible. You go from looking forward to 5, to looking forward to whenever you get to the office. You go from someone people don’t enjoy being around at work to someone they do.\\n\\nLastly don’t run after someone else’s dream. We are all wired differently and created differently and just because it looks great or looks happy doesn’t mean you will be happy in it. Go after what fuels you and what you love doing to change the world.\\n\\n(These are not coherent thoughts, I KNOW, but hopefully they will somehow make sense as you read this.

Both are true but you still have to protect yourself and demand your value. But I will say the days become more enjoyable and you go from feeling like you have to prove yourself to nothing is impossible. You go from looking forward to 5, to looking forward to whenever you get to the office. You go from someone people don’t enjoy being around at work to someone they do.\\n\\nLastly don’t run after someone else’s dream. We are all wired differently and created differently and just because it looks great or looks happy doesn’t mean you will be happy in it. Go after what fuels you and what you love doing to change the world.\\n\\n(These are not coherent thoughts, I KNOW, but hopefully they will somehow make sense as you read this. This is not an attempt at a pulitzer but more an attempt to share my journey of finding something I love enough to do as much as I can.)\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2018-05-25T20:40:32.000Z","slug":"find-what-you-love-and-never-look-back","status":"published","title":"Find what you love and never look back.","updated_at":"2018-05-25T21:00:35.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"19e6-KukDGi1EsJnrtVjT3sFqi00BBso\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"76ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-05-25T21:00:38.507Z","v":0}

All of them have different dynamics and different trials but one thing in common, GREAT PEOPLE. The best thing is that they were perfect people for where I was at in my working career too.\\n\\nBoosterthon had guys that brought me out of my shell and made me learn to be comfortable in whatever environment I was thrown in from being in front of a screaming, excited kindergartener to talking to an administrator about the challenge of the day.\\n\\nFreetextbooks had a CEO in Jonathan Robinson that expected and looked to me to figure out my own schedule and the path to get to our ultimate goal. He taught me that someone its going to always be there to hold your hand and show you the way. (more on this in a future post about grad school).\\n\\nThen there is the current job, Devote Studio, where I am surrounded by brilliant people, solving what seem like impossible problems, pushing us beyond what we think are our limits digitally and creatively.\\n\\nWhen you work with people who put others before themselves, who strive to figure out things beyond their job description, that put in the extra hours, effort, and thought, you can only win even when the world tells you that you failed. Having coworkers that communicate not only about work but what is going on outside the office, then you have more then an office you have a family. You see, our lives don’t start and stop at the office door. We are affected by home at work, just like we are at home from work. I have heard countless times, “don’t let your work life affect your home”. For me thats easy cause there is no one at home.\\n\\nBut there is a flip side to the coin. We have so much going on else where outside of the office, and that is not always roses and dandelions. Having people at work that can spot it and know you enough to want to hear about it first but also to speak life into you, is something to search for more then salary, cool office space or snacks.\\n\\nCommunication and mutual understanding is also important to be able to deliver great products. You can’t work as a team without learning to communicate well and especially in our industry. Too many different skill sets combined with even more moving parts. At booster it was having different wiring make ups on each team, but now its different skills.\\n\\nIts a blessing to work with a team like this and to see where their minds and talents take them. It makes it easy to work those late nights and early mornings. Those projects that end up going in places you never thought they would. Its a team that helps you through times that are good and times that are bad, that build you up but also jab at you to keep you on your toes. It drives you to want to learn more and go farther.\\n\\nCare who you work with, they are the important part.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2017-03-15T20:47:00.000Z","slug":"who-you-work-with-is-so-important","status":"published","title":"Who you work with is so important!","updated_at":"2018-06-04T13:54:12.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":null,"status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1588-icP92U0/HHBwH6kfaUnhOHrKK9c\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"76ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-06-04T13:54:14.080Z","v":0}

Whats crazy is how adamant people are about that there way is the only way or that in some way you are selfish or not cultured enough if you don’t do something, usually while you are young.\\n\\nIn my experience and opinion we are all wired differently thankfully and by that measure we will all grow and experience things differently. There is no one way and there is no right way but here are a few of my thoughts based on my experiences.\\n\\n    1. Make sure you have deep relationships that you invest and pour into. If you hold back and only have surface level relationships then you will never truly understand yourself but also never truly know those around you.\\n    2. Live in a different country BUT also live in a different city in the US. Now I am not saying live there some set period of time or that you have to do this. But go somewhere longer then a vacation and immerse yourself in the culture. One important thing to remember though is to live outside your bubble and with the outside the country part, make it one that is different in someway then here. And I don’t mean the food.\\n    3.

But go somewhere longer then a vacation and immerse yourself in the culture. One important thing to remember though is to live outside your bubble and with the outside the country part, make it one that is different in someway then here. And I don’t mean the food.\\n    4. Read as much as you can, and not just about stuff you agree with or are interested in. This is something I figured out late but it really transforms how I learned and grew over the last couple of years. Don’t wait until you are in certain stages of live to learn about things either.\\n    5. Get out and explore in your own community. You don’t have to get on a plane to experience things. Yeah Italy makes a nice Instagram and there is great food in New York and San Francisco, but some of my favorite new places are right around me. This also requires getting out and getting off the couch.\\n    6. Lastly, try to continue reaching out to new circles of friends around you.

Whats crazy is how adamant people are about that there way is the only way or that in some way you are selfish or not cultured enough if you don’t do something, usually while you are young.\\n\\nIn my experience and opinion we are all wired differently thankfully and by that measure we will all grow and experience things differently. There is no one way and there is no right way but here are a few of my thoughts based on my experiences.\\n\\n    1. Make sure you have deep relationships that you invest and pour into. If you hold back and only have surface level relationships then you will never truly understand yourself but also never truly know those around you.\\n    2. Live in a different country BUT also live in a different city in the US. Now I am not saying live there some set period of time or that you have to do this. But go somewhere longer then a vacation and immerse yourself in the culture. One important thing to remember though is to live outside your bubble and with the outside the country part, make it one that is different in someway then here. And I don’t mean the food.\\n    3.

But go somewhere longer then a vacation and immerse yourself in the culture. One important thing to remember though is to live outside your bubble and with the outside the country part, make it one that is different in someway then here. And I don’t mean the food.\\n    4. Read as much as you can, and not just about stuff you agree with or are interested in. This is something I figured out late but it really transforms how I learned and grew over the last couple of years. Don’t wait until you are in certain stages of live to learn about things either.\\n    5. Get out and explore in your own community. You don’t have to get on a plane to experience things. Yeah Italy makes a nice Instagram and there is great food in New York and San Francisco, but some of my favorite new places are right around me. This also requires getting out and getting off the couch.\\n    6. Lastly, try to continue reaching out to new circles of friends around you. We are by nature people of tribes, to take a note from Seth Godin. We have circles of friends and we build communities around them. But we also should continue to grow those circles and connect them together with others.\\n    \\nLike I said we all experience and learn in different ways, these are just my thoughts.

All of them have different dynamics and different trials but one thing in common, GREAT PEOPLE. The best thing is that they were perfect people for where I was at in my working career too.\\n\\nBoosterthon had guys that brought me out of my shell and made me learn to be comfortable in whatever environment I was thrown in from being in front of a screaming, excited kindergartener to talking to an administrator about the challenge of the day.\\n\\nFreetextbooks had a CEO in Jonathan Robinson that expected and looked to me to figure out my own schedule and the path to get to our ultimate goal. He taught me that someone its going to always be there to hold your hand and show you the way. (more on this in a future post about grad school).\\n\\nThen there is the current job, Devote Studio, where I am surrounded by brilliant people, solving what seem like impossible problems, pushing us beyond what we think are our limits digitally and creatively.\\n\\nWhen you work with people who put others before themselves, who strive to figure out things beyond their job description, that put in the extra hours, effort, and thought, you can only win even when the world tells you that you failed. Having coworkers that communicate not only about work but what is going on outside the office, then you have more then an office you have a family. You see, our lives don’t start and stop at the office door. We are affected by home at work, just like we are at home from work. I have heard countless times, “don’t let your work life affect your home”. For me thats easy cause there is no one at home.\\n\\nBut there is a flip side to the coin. We have so much going on else where outside of the office, and that is not always roses and dandelions. Having people at work that can spot it and know you enough to want to hear about it first but also to speak life into you, is something to search for more then salary, cool office space or snacks.\\n\\nCommunication and mutual understanding is also important to be able to deliver great products. You can’t work as a team without learning to communicate well and especially in our industry. Too many different skill sets combined with even more moving parts. At booster it was having different wiring make ups on each team, but now its different skills.\\n\\nIts a blessing to work with a team like this and to see where their minds and talents take them. It makes it easy to work those late nights and early mornings. Those projects that end up going in places you never thought they would. Its a team that helps you through times that are good and times that are bad, that build you up but also jab at you to keep you on your toes. It drives you to want to learn more and go farther.\\n\\nCare who you work with, they are the important part.\"}]],\"sections\":[[10,0]]}","page":false,"published_at":"2017-03-15T20:47:00.000Z","slug":"who-you-work-with-is-so-important","status":"published","title":"Who you work with is so important!","updated_at":"2018-06-04T13:54:14.000Z","authors":{"0":{"id":"1","name":"Trey Jackson","slug":"trey","email":"jacksrf@gmail.com","profile_image":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d10633a03ede75056d8c242256c3261?s=250&d=mm&r=x","cover_image":null,"bio":null,"website":null,"location":null,"accessibility":"{\"nightShift\":true}","status":"active","locale":null,"meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"last_seen":{},"created_at":{},"updated_at":{},"facebook":null,"twitter":null,"tour":"[\"getting-started\",\"using-the-editor\",\"static-post\",\"featured-post\",\"upload-a-theme\"]"}},"tags":{}}}},"query":{"include":"authors,tags,authors.roles"}},"res":{"_headers":{"x-powered-by":"Express","cache-control":"no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate, max-stale=0, post-check=0, pre-check=0","access-control-allow-origin":"http://localhost:2368","vary":"Origin, Accept-Encoding","x-cache-invalidate":"/*","content-type":"application/json; charset=utf-8","etag":"W/\"1618-dQUgGbx5wIMgF9SM/PGnNl8hx9E\"","content-encoding":"gzip"},"statusCode":200,"responseTime":"241ms"},"msg":"","time":"2018-06-06T13:15:05.239Z","v":0}
